Marlowe Dependency Documentation
================================

This cabal project and nix derivation simply collects the Haskell package versions upon which the [`main`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/tree/main) branch of [marlowe-cardano](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano) depends.

A local Hoogle interface and the Haddock documentation is served at http://localhost:8079 by running the command [`./serve-hoogle.sh`](serve-hoogle.sh).
